## 💭 The Story

> *"Eh, kemarin gue yang bayarin makan ya. Nanti transfer aja..."*
> 
> Three days pass. Nothing happens. Awkward silence in the group chat.

We've all been there. You're the one who always steps up — paying for dinner, covering the Grab, fronting the hotel deposit. You're **"Si Penalang"** (the one who advances money), and while you don't mind helping out, collecting the money back? That's where things get uncomfortable.

**Talangin** was born from this very Indonesian experience of *"ga enakan"* — that uniquely awkward feeling when you have to ask friends to pay you back.

<br>

## 🔴 The Problem

Managing shared expenses today is broken:

| Current Method | The Pain |
|----------------|----------|
| **WhatsApp** | Receipt photos scattered across chats. "Wait, how much was my portion again?" |
| **Spreadsheets** | Hours of manual calculations. One typo ruins everything. |
| **Existing Apps** | Everyone needs to download, sign up, add friends... most give up. |

### The Real Numbers
- **1-2 days** just to collect payment proofs from everyone
- **2-7 days** to reconcile a single trip's expenses
- **∞ awkward moments** when you have to personally remind friends about their debt

<br>

## ✨ The Solution

**Talangin** transforms the chaos of shared expenses into a seamless, drama-free experience.

```
📸 Scan → 🧮 Calculate → 🔗 Share → ✅ Done
```

### For Si Penalang (The Initiator)
You've done the hard part — paying for everyone. Now let us handle the rest. Scan receipts, and our algorithm figures out exactly who owes what. No spreadsheets. No mental math. No awkward "hey, you still owe me..." messages.

### For Everyone Else
Receive a link. See what you owe. Pay. That's it. **No app download required.**

<br>

## 🎯 Features

### 📱 Smart Scan (OCR)
Point your camera at any receipt. Our on-device AI instantly extracts items and prices. Just verify and you're done — no manual typing needed.

### 🧠 Intelligent Split Algorithm
Handle complex scenarios effortlessly:
- Andi paid for dinner (Rp 450,000)
- Budi paid for the Grab (Rp 85,000)  
- Cici didn't pay anything

**Result:** One-tap calculation of who transfers how much to whom. The algorithm optimizes for minimum transactions.

### 🔗 App Clips Magic
This is our superpower. Share a link to your group chat, and participants can:
- View their itemized bill
- See exactly what they owe
- Mark payment as complete

**All without downloading anything.** It just works.

### 🔔 Neutral Reminders
Let the app do the awkward part. Automated, friendly reminders that don't come from *you* — so friendships stay intact.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Privacy First
Your financial data never leaves your device. OCR processing? Local. Calculations? Local. We believe your money matters are nobody else's business.

### Minimal Friction
Every feature is designed to reduce steps, not add them. If it takes more than 3 taps, we redesign it.

### Culturally Aware
Built by Indonesians, for the way Indonesians actually manage group expenses. We understand *"ga enakan"* because we live it too.

<br>

## 👥 Who Is This For?

### Primary: Si Penalang
The initiators. The organizers. The ones who always step up to pay first. You deserve a tool that respects your time and saves your friendships.

### Secondary: Everyone Else
Friends, family, colleagues who just want to know "how much do I owe?" and settle up quickly — without another app cluttering their phone.

<br>

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Now** | Core split algorithm + OCR + App Clips |
| **Next** | Smart expense categories, recurring splits |
| **Later** | Multi-currency support, group analytics |

*Payment gateway integration is intentionally not on our roadmap. We focus on what we do best: organizing and calculating. Transfer via your preferred method.*

<br>

## 🇮🇩 Made with ❤️ in Indonesia
